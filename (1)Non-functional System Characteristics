Availability

What is availablity ?
Availablity is the percentage of time that a system is accessible to clients and is oprated upon normal condition. For example if a system is 100% available 
that means the system is behaving normaly with said functions all the time.

Mathematically availablity "A" is the ratio which can be define as 

Availablity "A" =  (Total Time - Amount of time system functionality is Down) 
                  ___________________________________________________________ X 100
                                                Total Time 

Higher the "A" value is better.
