Availability

Example:

Let's consider a financial transaction system that needs to maintain high availability. The system has the following characteristics over a one-year period:

Total Uptime: 364 days
Total Downtime: 1 day

Step-by-Step Calculation:

Convert days to hours (if necessary):

365 x 24 hours/day  = 8760 hours
364 x 24 hours/day  = 8736 hours

Total downtime in hours

1 x 24 hours/day = 24 hours

Availablity "A" =  [ 8736 / (8736+24)] = 0.9972 â‰ˆ 99.72 %
